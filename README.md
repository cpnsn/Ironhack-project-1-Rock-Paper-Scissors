# Rock Paper STAR!

## Why a Rock Paper Scissors game?

- My first game idea probably would have been too complicated for me
- A Rock Paper Scissors game was not my idea but I liked it :
  I could actually see myself doing it
  and I could choose a theme and personalize it

  ## Mistakes I've made

- Doing my CSS first

- Not naming my classes correctly

- Not organizing my code enough

- Using way too many “else if”

## Next steps

- Add two more characters
- Get rid of all the “else if”
- Work on my CSS
- Make it responsive!
